## hey, I’m Hridhaan 

I’m a student who enjoys building things and figuring stuff out along the way.  
Most of my work sits at the intersection of **tech, engineering, and curiosity**.


### what I’m usually working on
- Researching and Learning 
- experiments related to space, astronomy, and engineering  
- learning new technologies by actually using them
- Making cool projects
- trying out new tools and languages  

If you’re curious about what I’m building right now,  
You can more context on my website.
